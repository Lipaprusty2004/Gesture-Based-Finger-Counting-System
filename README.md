ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Finger Counting using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time finger counting using a webcam feed and OpenCV for image processing. It utilizes hand landmark detection to accurately identify and count raised fingers.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Single-Hand Finger Counting â€“ Detects and counts fingers from one hand.

Dual-Hand Finger Counting â€“ Detects and counts fingers from both hands simultaneously.

Sequential Left & Right Hand Counting â€“ Counts fingers on the left hand first, then the right hand, and finally displays the total finger count.

ðŸš€ How It Works

Captures live video from the webcam.

Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe.

Uses finger tip positions to determine which fingers are raised.

Displays the count in real-time on the video feed.
